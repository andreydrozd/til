# TIL (Today I Learned)

Repo for recording what I've learned. This will serve as a reference, since the internet is so terrible with link lifespans.

I got this idea from other similar repos, like [jwworth/til](https://github.com/jwworth/til) and [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til)
